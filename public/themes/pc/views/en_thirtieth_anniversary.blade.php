				<div class="t">At the prime time after 30 years of development, forge ahead to open up a new situation!</div>
                <p>In 2021, VTR officially ushered in the special moment of its 30th anniversary. In 1991, in Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, VTR Enzyme Preparation Co., Ltd. (VTR’s predecessor) was established, which broke the pattern that foreign enterprises monopolized the market in the past, thus China's forage enzyme preparation industry started its development. After 30 years of leapfrog development, VTR has become the first listed enterprise in the field of biological enzyme preparation in China, a highly competitive steroid hormone pharmaceutical enterprise in the world, and a leading enterprise in the field of “antimicrobial-free” feed. The year 2021 is the first year of China’s 14th Five-year Plan”. At a higher starting point, VTR, as a leading biotechnology enterprise in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, will continue to carry out biotechnology innovation. Based on the fields of biological enzyme preparation, biomedicine, animal nutrition and health, VTR will launch more forward-looking products in combination with policies, industry development trends, etc., so as to meet the needs of the industry with excellent products and services and make unremitting efforts to build a green and healthy life for mankind!
